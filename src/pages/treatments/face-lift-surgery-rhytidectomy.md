  A facelift, also known as a rhytidectomy, is a surgical procedure to improve the appearance of the face and neck. The surgery can involve removing excess skin and fat, tightening muscles, or repositioning bones. A facelift can be used to reduce wrinkles, sagging skin, and age spots. It may also be used to correct deformities caused by injuries or birth defects. A facelift can help people look younger and more attractive.
