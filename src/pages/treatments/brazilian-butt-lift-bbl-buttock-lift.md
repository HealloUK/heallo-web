description: >-
  A Brazilian butt lift is a surgical procedure that uses fat grafting to increase the size and shape of the buttocks. Fat is harvested from other parts of the body, such as the abdomen or thighs, and injected into the buttocks. The surgery is designed to add volume and shape to the buttocks, giving them a more rounded and lifted appearance. Results from a Brazilian butt lift are long lasting, providing patients with a more youthful and aesthetically pleasing appearance for many years after surgery. Patients can return to work within a few days.
