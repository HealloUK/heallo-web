        A hair transplant is a surgical procedure that moves hair follicles from one part of the body to another.
        Most commonly, hair transplants are used to restore hair loss on the scalp. The surgeon extracts donor hairs from the back or sides of the scalp. Creates tiny incisions in the balding area and inserts the donor hairs into them. Closes up the incisions with stitches or staples.
