  Gastric sleeve surgery, also known as sleeve gastrectomy, is a surgical procedure in which the stomach is reduced to about 25% of its original size by removing most of the stomach tissue. This reduces the amount of food that can be eaten at one time and helps patients lose weight.
  The surgery is usually done using laparoscopic techniques, meaning that it is performed through several small incisions in the abdomen.
