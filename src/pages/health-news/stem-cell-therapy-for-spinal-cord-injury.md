The brain is constantly in communication with the whole body. This communication occurs through the spinal cord. You can think of the spinal cord as a cable that allows us to transfer information between computers. Millions of nerve cells inside this cable interact with each other, allowing information to be transmitted along the cable.

Each cell in this cable is so important that they are protected by 3 layers of tissue, which doctors call the "meninges."

* Dura mater: This hard and protective coating is the outer layer.
* Epidural space: This part is an intermediate layer. During epidural anesthesia, the drug is injected into this layer.
* Arachnoid mater: It is the middle layer of the spinal cord covering.
* Subarachnoid space: Located between the arachnoid mater and the pia mater. Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) is found in this region. Fluid can be taken from here to detect some infections. In addition, the drug is injected into this area under local anesthesia.
* Pia mater: It is the innermost layer of the spinal cord covering. It is in direct contact with the spinal cord.

At the outermost of these layers, the spine provides strong protection by surrounding the spinal cord with rigid vertebrae.

## **Neural Pathways**

Just like the highways that allow us to travel by car, our nervous system also has highways through which information can travel. These neural highways, which are formed by connecting many brain cells (neurons) to each other, provide information transport from one point of the nervous system to another. We call these highways in our nervous system neural pathways.

The neural pathways that provide communication between the brain and spinal cord are divided into ascending and descending pathways (tracts). For example, when someone tickles you, information that you have been tickled reaches the brain through one channel, while the reflex response of the brain is transmitted to the body through the other channel.

## Ascending Pathways

As the name suggests, ascending pathways carry information from bottom to top. In other words, it transmits information such as pain, heat, touch that can come from many parts of the body to the brain. That's why we call this naural pathway sensory pathways.

There are receptors in our skin, muscles and organs that detect physical and chemical changes in the internal and external environment. Receptors convert this information from outside into electrical signals. These signals reach the Ascending Pathways via the nerves in the body. From there it is transmitted to the brain.

## Descending Pathways

The path of the data is the opposite of that in Ascending Pathways. On these pathways, called motor pathways, information is transmitted from the brain to other parts of the body. This information from the brain governs voluntary and involuntary movements, reflexes and muscle contraction.

## **What is Neuron?**

A neuron (nerve cell) is a specialized cell for transmitting electrical information in the body.

We can divide neurons into two main categories according to the region they are located in. Those found in the Brain and Spinal Cord (Central Nervous System) and those found in the peripheral nervous system.

Neurons release a substance called a neurotransmitter to communicate. We can call this substance chemical messengers. These chemical messages sent can be received by another neuron, glands or muscles.

The message travels along the axon and is released into the synapse. Synapses are contact points that allow electrical or chemical message transmission between a neuron and another neuron or target cell. The neurotransmitter released into the synapse enables communication between two neurons. Synapses usually form between axons and dendrites.

## **Myelin Sheath the Signal Booster**

The electrical cables we use in our daily life are insulated with plastic material so that the electric current does not interact with the external environment. Myalin Sheath is a lipid-rich insulating material that surrounds the axons (the nervous system's "wires") that transmit electrical signals. In this way, it prevents the signals from losing their power by being affected by environmental factors.

Signals are transmitted much faster in myalinated axons than in unmyalinated axons. Therefore, most neurons in the nervous system are myalinated. Myalin does not completely cover the axon. There are spaces between the myalin sheaths. These gaps are called nodes of ranvier. There are sodium channels inside these nodes. When the signal reaches the node, the sodium channel opens, and sodium ions enter this region rapidly. This rapid entry of sodium ions ensures that the signal is renewed and strengthened. The strengthened signal advances rapidly to the next node. The signal looks like jumping from node to node. This type of hopping conduction is called saltatory conduction.

## **How is Myelin Sheath made?**

The myalin sheath is made by glial cells. Glia cells are helpers that protect and support neurons. There are many different types of glial cells. Oligodendrocytes, one of them, cover neurons in the central nervous system with a myalin sheath. Swann cells are also responsible for myalination in the peripheral nervous system.

## **Myelin Sheath Damage**

If the myalin sheath is damaged for some reason, the transmission of electrical signals cannot occur properly. This can endanger many vital functions. For example, in MS disease, the immune system elements that are normally responsible for protecting the body attack the myelin sheath and the cells that produce it. Signal transmission rate slows down in the axon whose isolation is deteriorated. This can cause fatigue, balance disorders, visual disturbances and even paralysis.

## **Spinal Cord Injury**

The spinal cord is the main communication line that enables the brain to communicate with the body from the neck to the coccyx. A hard blow, pressure, or a cut can interrupt communication on the spinal cord. Damage to the spinal cord produces different results depending on the region. The message transmitted from the brain reaches the damaged area and cannot be transmitted further from that area. For this reason, numbness and paralysis occur in areas where communication cannot be established.

Depending on where and how severe the injury is, patients may lose the ability to move (paralysis), feel sensations, or control their bowels.

> “[According to research](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2846285/#:~:text=Central%20nervous%20system%20(CNS)%20axons,function%20after%20peripheral%20nerve%20damage), Central nervous system (CNS) axons do not spontaneously regenerate after injury in adult mammals. In contrast, peripheral nervous system (PNS) axons readily regenerate, allowing recovery of function after peripheral nerve damage.”

Since the body cannot replace cells destroyed by spinal cord injuries, these injuries often lead to permanent movement and sensation impairments.

## **Treatment**

There is no effective treatment to restore spinal cord function at this time. The current treatment for people with a spinal cord injury is focused on preventing further injury and helping them to lead an active and productive life.

Immediate immobilisation and bracing to stabilise the spine,can help to reduce damage to nerve cells.

## **Stem cells and spinal-cord injuries**

Spinal cord injury treatment with stem cell is still an experimental treatment in its early stages. In order for a treatment to prove its reliability, the same conditions must be established again and again and the same results must be obtained.

Many researchers are investigating the efficacy and safety of stem cell in the treatment of spinal cord injury. Many studies have shown promising results regarding the safety and efficacy of stem cells.

Treatment of spinal cord injury with stem cell is a challenging topic for researchers. Because spinal cord injuries can occur in many different ways. The problems it creates in the body also differ. Therefore, different types of injuries may require different approaches.

Spinal cord injuries can damage neurons and the supporting cells that surround them with a myalin sheath. Damage to the supporting cells can also cause the death of functional neurons. Researchers are investigating how stem cells can regenerate damaged neurons and support cells, focusing on the ability of stem cells to differentiate into many different cell types.

In addition, researchers are working on the use of stem cell to minimize additional damage by preventing harmful substances emitted from the damaged cell from damaging the surrounding healthy cells.

## **Why do we think that stem cells can be useful in the treatment of spinal cord injury?**

In animal experiments, a lot of information has been obtained about how stem cell transplantation can help in the treatment of spinal cord injury;

* Can [replace](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8056014/) damaged nerve cells
* Capable of [differentiating into oligodendrocytes](https://www.science.org/doi/abs/10.1126/science.abb8795), which are essential for remyelinating axons around an injury
* [Reducing the destructive inflammation](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7765947/#:~:text=MSCs%2C%20as%20well%20as%20other,and%20anti%2Dinflammatory%20factor%20release.) that might develop after injury to stop it from spreading

The studies we have mentioned and many more completed and ongoing studies encourage researchers that stem cell is a strong candidate for the treatment of spinal cord injury.

## **Yale scientists repair injured spinal cords using patients’ own stem cells**

Researchers from Yale University in the United States and Sapporo Medical University School of Medicine in Japan gave 13 patients with spinal cord injuries (SCI) their own stem cells, derived from the bone marrow, intravenously. During the 6-month period, there were significant improvements in key sensory or motor functions of all patients except one. It was reported that more than half of the patients showed improvement in walking, using their hands, and many other functions within weeks after stem cell injection. In many patients, the effects were seen in just a few days. In addition, no significant side effects were reported.

The patients were those who had sustained non-penetrating (their spinal cords were not severed) spinal cord injuries due to serious accidents a few weeks before stem cell implantation. They had symptoms such as loss of ability to control movement (motor function), feeling (sensory) loss, bowel and bladder dysfunction.

Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs), which have an important role in tissue repair and regeneration due to their ability to transform into many different cells, were used in the study.

After the cells were taken from the patient's bone marrow, they were multiplied after a few weeks in a special cell processing center and made ready for application. These cells were injected into the patient intravenously.

> "The idea that we may be able to restore function after injury to the brain and spinal cord using the patient's own stem cells has intrigued us for years," explains neurologist Stephen Waxman from Yale University, a senior author of the study . "Now we have a hint, in humans, that it may be possible."

Researchers state that the intravenous infusion method, that is, injecting cells through a vein, may have some advantages.

"Importantly, intravenously infused MSCs may affect not only the injury site, but other parts of the central nervous system including brain and blood vessels," the authors [explain in their paper](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0303846721000925).

While the researchers acknowledge that this experiment was a small study with several limitations—the possibility of some of the recoveries seen were spontaneous—they argue that the data obtained tells us we are looking at a safe and viable study. They also state that studies with more patients should be continued.

> "Although this initial case study was unblinded and uncontrolled, the SCI patients appeared to demonstrate a tendency of relatively rapid improvement of neurological function that was often apparent within a few days following infusion of MSCs," [the team writes](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0303846721000925).
