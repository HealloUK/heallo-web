## Is it safe?

Non surgical butt lift is a safe and effective procedure that can help you achieve the look you desire. This procedure uses targeted injections of dermal fillers to contour and shape the buttocks. Dermal fillers are composed of natural or synthetic materials that are injected into the skin to add volume and improve the appearance of wrinkles, scars, and other blemishes. The results of a non surgical butt lift are immediate and long lasting, providing you with a more youthful appearance.


## Dermal fillers and Sculptra?

Dermal fillers are a popular choice for people looking to improve the appearance of their butt. There are many different types of dermal fillers available, and each one has its own unique benefits. Some dermal fillers are designed to provide temporary results, while others offer more long-term solutions.

One of the most popular types of dermal filler for butt augmentation is Sculptra. Sculptra is a poly-L-lactic acid (PLLA) filler that helps to restore volume and contour to the skin. It can be used on all areas of the body, including the face, neck, and décolletage. When used on the buttocks, it can help to create a fuller and more rounded appearance.

Sculptra is made from biocompatible materials that are gradually absorbed by the body over time. This makes it a safe choice for those who want long-lasting results without having to worry about any adverse side effects. In addition, because Sculptra stimulates collagen production in the skin, it also helps to improve overall skin health and texture.

## How Do Non Surgical Butt Lifts Work?
First, the treatment areas are marked. With the microcannula, the sculptra is injected into the areas of your buttocks where you want to add volume. The treatment takes around 1 hour. Most patients need 2-3 sessions to achieve the results they want. The result of the Sculptra butt lift application usually takes 2-3 years.

## Who is a good candidate?

First of all, you should be in good health and have realistic expectations. The best candidate for a non surgical butt lift is someone who is looking to improve the appearance of their buttocks but does not want or need surgery. Non surgical butt lifts are also a good option for people who have had surgery and are not happy with the results.

## Conclusion

There are many benefits to choosing a non surgical butt lift over surgery. One of these is that it is typically much less expensive than surgery. It is also considered much safer, with fewer risks involved. Additionally, non surgical butt lifts do not require any recovery time, so you can get back to your normal routine immediately after treatment is complete. Finally, they offer many of the same results as surgery but without some of the potential downsides like pain and scarring.
