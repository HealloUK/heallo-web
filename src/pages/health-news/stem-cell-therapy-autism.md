## **What is Autism?**

Autism spectrum disorders(ASD) is a developmental disorder that affects communication and social interaction. ASD begins in early childhood and lasts throughout a person's life. People with ASD have difficulty with social communication skills, such as understanding body language or facial expressions. They may also have trouble holding a conversation or starting one. Many people with ASD prefer to be alone and avoid social situations. People with ASD often have restricted interests and engage in repetitive behaviors such as lining up objects or spinning them around.

## **Why do we call it Spectrum?**

A spectrum is an entire range of similar things, for example, all available colors in painter's paint palette. We can think of each symptom of autism as different color in palette. Individuals with Autism are like works of art using very different colors. Just as works of art are different and unique, the symptoms experienced by individuals with autism and their way of perceiving life are different from each other.

People often rate individuals with autism between slightly autistic and highly autistic. But this is a very restrictive perspective.

It is more correct to think of autistic individuals as in the picture below. The experiences of two individuals with the same level of autism can be completely different.

## **Types of Autism Spectrum Disorders**

We thought of each symptom of autism as a different color. We thought of individuals with autism as pictures of people painted in different colors. Autism is divided into different classes according to which of these colors the person has and in what intensity.

**Asperger’s syndrome**\
Symptoms are less severe and there is no language delay.

**Autistic Disorder**\
Symptoms are more severe and there may be serious communication problems. They needed a lot of support.

**Pervasive developmental disorder not otherwise specified (PDD-NOS)**\
As can be understood from the title, people who do not fully comply with the first two groups are classified in this group.

## **What Are the Symptoms of Autism?**

If your child is on the Autism spectrum, they may show the following symptoms;

* Failing to respond to their name by their first birthday
* Avoiding eye contact
* They prefer to be alone
* Not responding to emotions - If you smile them, they don't smile back
* They may not want to hug or be close to others
* Repetitive movements, such as flapping their hands
* They don't like to be comforted when they're upset

## **What Are the Causes of Autism?**

The cause of autism is unknown, but it is believed to be caused by a combination of genetic and environmental factors. Some possible causes of Autism include:

* **Genetic factors:** Autism may be caused by changes in certain genes that control brain development.
* **Environmental factors:** Exposure to certain toxins or viruses during pregnancy may increase the risk for autism.
* **Brain differences:** Differences in the structure or function of the brain may play a role in causing autism.

## **How do Doctors Diagnose Autism?**

Doctors diagnose autism spectrum disorder by looking at a child's behavior and development. 

There is no one test that can diagnose autism, so doctors use a variety of tools to make a diagnosis. One tool doctors use is the Autism Diagnostic Observation Schedule (ADOS), which is a series of tests that help measure how well a child communicates, interacts with others, and uses language. 

Another tool used to diagnose autism is the Autism Spectrum Quotient (AQ), which is an online quiz for parents and caregivers that helps them determine if their child might have autism. If doctors think there might be something wrong with a child's development, they will often refer the child to specialists who can help make a diagnosis. These specialists might include pediatricians, neurologists, psychologists, or psychiatrists.

## **What are the Treatments For Autism?**

There is no standard treatment for autism. Treatment for autism can involve a number of different approaches, depending on the severity of symptoms and the age of the person. For example, children with autism may benefit from early intervention programs that aim to improve social skills, communication skills, and academic performance. These types of programs are usually delivered by trained professionals in schools or clinics.

Therapy is the main treatment for autism. Treatment includes working with a therapist or specialist who will teach your child how to communicate with others and how to interact with people in appropriate ways. Your child may need therapy for several years after diagnosis, especially if he has a severe form of the disorder.

There are many strategies aimed at reducing the symptoms of individuals with autism and increasing their potential.



According to the [NIH](https://www.nichd.nih.gov/health/topics/autism/conditioninfo/treatments), some of these strategies:

* Cognitive behavior therapy
* Behavioral management therapy
* Educational and school-based therapies
* Early intervention
* Medications / Pharmaceuticals
* Joint attention therapy
* Occupational and work-related therapy
* Nutritional therapy / Diet Modification
* Physical therapy (PT)
* Parent-mediated therapy
* Speech-language therapy
* Social skills training

## **Childhood Autism Rating Scale (CARS)**

The Childhood Autism Rating Scale (CARS) is a 15-item behavioral rating scale used for the diagnosis of autism spectrum disorders. Each item is rated from 1 (within normal limits) to 4 (severely abnormal).

As a result of the test, the person gets a score between 15 and 60.\
**Below 30:** Nonautistic\
**30-36.5:** Mild-Moderate Autism \
**37–60:** Severe Autism

## **Stem Cell Therapy for Autism**

Although the use of Stem Cell in the treatment of Autism is still experimental, many clinical trials show that this subject has great potential. Stem Cells have the ability to transform into any cell in the body. When the stem cell is injected into the target area, it is expected to renew and repair the tissue in that area.

#### Autoimmune disorders link for autism

**A [later study](https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncel.2018.00405/full)** showed a link between Autism and autoimmune disorder. 

According to study; As the members with autoimmune disorders in a family increased, so did the risk that a child in that family would have autism.

Now we have a clue. One of the points we should focus on while looking for a solution for the treatment of autism may be **how to treat Autoimmune disorders**.

#### Inflammation link for autism

Researchers from Tufts University School of Medicine compared 8 children with autism with 8 children without autism. They found very high levels of a molecule known to trigger inflammation in the affected areas - the areas responsible for memory and attention - of the brains of autistic children.** [More Details About Research](https://www.pnas.org/doi/full/10.1073/pnas.1906817116)**

> **"Increasing evidence supports the presence of immune dysfunction and inflammation in the brains of children with ASD,” the authors concluded."(1)**

Second magic word is **inflammation.** Seems like another point to focus on. 

The **regenerative and immunomodulatory features of stem cell** receive attention to its use in the **treatment of autism**. **Immunomodulatory** refers to the ability to make changes on the **immune system**.

**This [study](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/20525442/)** highlight one of very important aspects of MSC therapy;\
**Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs)** have the ability to modulate T-cell-mediated immunological responses. This suggests that MSCs could be used to treat certain **autoimmune diseases**.



#### Can stem cell be used to reduce inflammation?

Many research show that stem cells can significantly reduce **inflammation** in the body. \
You can read [this study from Duke University](https://neurosurgery.duke.edu/news/new-study-focuses-how-stem-cells-reduce-inflammation) examines how Stem Cell reduces inflammation and continues to suppress inflammation even after it has been eliminated from the body.

**A growing number of research are encouraging us on the efficacy and safety of stem cell therapy for Autism.**

## **5 Research for Stem Cell Therapy in Children With Autism**

You can follow completed and ongoing studies on Stem Cell and Autism at clinicaltrials.gov.\
When we search for **autism AND stem cells**,  **[28 research results](https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/results?cond=&term=autism+AND+stem+cells)** appear.

Since we will not be able to review all studies in this article, we will review a meta-analysis report. Meta-analysis is the examination of many research results on the same subject as if they were a single study. In this study, 5 studies on **stem cell for autism** were selected. You can think of meta-analysis as a summary of these 5 studies.

**Research Link: [https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fped.2022.897398](https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fped.2022.897398/full#B15)**

[In this study](https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fped.2022.897398/full#B15), the results of 5 studies were examined together and the **Efficacy and Safety of Stem Cell Therapy in Children with Autism Spectrum Disorder** was investigated.

**Aim:** To find new evidence regarding the efficacy and safety of stem cell therapy in children with autism spectrum disorders.

**Methods:** Studies selected from PubMed/Medline, Web of Science, EMBASE, Cochrane Library, and China Academic Journal resources up to 24th JULY 2021. Studies with a risk of bias were excluded from the list using the Cochrane tool.



**The following 5 research results were analyzed together;**

1. Intrathecal autologous bone marrow stem cell therapy in children with autism: A randomized controlled trial(3)
2. Safety and efficacy of cord blood mononuclear cells and umbilical cord mesenchymal stem cells therapy for childhood autism(4)
3. A phase II randomized clinical trial of the safety and efficacy of intravenous umbilical cord blood infusion for treatment of children with autism spectrum disorder(5)
4. Safety and Observations from a Placebo-Controlled, Crossover Study to Assess Use of Autologous Umbilical Cord Blood Stem Cells to Improve Symptoms in Children with Autism(6)
5. Transplantation of human cord blood mononuclear cells and umbilical cord-derived mesenchymal stem cells in autism(7)

**Result:** The data showed that the **Childhood Autism Rating Scale (CARS)** score of the group that received stem cell therapy was significantly lower than those that did not. (A lower CARS score means fewer autism symptoms.) There was no significant difference between the stem cell group and the other group in terms of adverse reactions.

> **"Conclusion:** The results of this meta-analysis suggested that stem cell therapy for children with autism might be safe and effective. However, the evidence was compromised by the limitations in current study size, lacking standardized injection routes and doses of stem cells, as well as shortages in diagnostic tools and long period follow-up studies. Hence, it calls for more studies to systematically confirm the efficacy and safety of stem cell therapy for children with autism spectrum disorders."(2)
