Hair transplantation was first introduced in the late 1950s by Dr. Norman Orentreich (1905-1980). Since then, there have been many advances in technique, but the procedure remains essentially the same today as it did then - as does its popularity among patients with significant hair loss problems.

## **What is a hair transplant?**

A hair transplant is a surgical procedure that moves hair follicles from one part of the body to another. Usually the hair on the sides and back of the head is carried to the front of the head.

**Local anesthesia** is used so that you do not feel pain during the treatment.

## **What are the Different Types of Hair Transplants?**

#### There are a few different types of hair transplants: slit grafts, micrografts, and punch grafts.

**Slit grafts** are when the surgeon takes a thin strip of hair from the back of your head and then cuts it into small pieces to transplant onto your balding areas. This type of surgery is usually used for people who have bald patches that are wider than 1 inch.

**Micrografts** are when the surgeon takes tiny plugs of hair (usually about 1-4 hairs per plug) from the back of your head and transplants them onto your balding areas. This type of surgery is usually used for people who have smaller bald patches or who want to restore their hairline.

**Punch grafts** are when the surgeon takes a circular piece out of the donor area (usually around 3-6 mm in diameter) and implants it into the recipient area. **Punch grafting** is generally used for treating scars or very small areas where there isn’t enough donor hair available to use slit or **micrografting** techniques.

## **Who is a Good Candidate for Hair Transplant?**

First and foremost, it is important to have realistic expectations about what hair transplant surgery can achieve.
It is not a miracle cure – it will not restore all of your lost hair or make you look like you did in your twenties again.

However, if done correctly, hair transplant surgery can restore thinning or balding areas on the scalp and improve your appearance significantly.

Another important consideration when deciding whether or not to undergo a hair transplant procedure is the health of your donor area – that is, the area on your head from which the surgeon will extract hairs for implantation into balding or thinning areas.

The donor area must be healthy and have an adequate supply of healthy hairs in order for the procedure to be successful.

If you have any doubts about the health of your donor area, it may be wise to consult with a doctor before making a decision about whether or not to proceed with surgery.

## **The Pros and Cons of Hair Transplants**

### **Pros**

* Long lasting solution
* Simple surgical procedure with minimal downtime
* Natural look
* The person's own hair is used in the procedure
* Safe
* Straightforward procedure

### **Cons**

* Hair transplants can be expensive depending on where you go for your procedure (and how many sessions it takes)
* Long recovery period
* Infection risk. In order to minimize the risk of infection, you should take good care of the transplanted area after the surgery

## **How is Hair Transplant Performed?**

After cleaning the scalp, Surgeon applies **local anesthesia** with a small needle to the back of the head.

There are two main types of hair transplant surgery: **follicular unit transplantation (FUT)** and **follicular unit extraction (FUE)**. FUT is more common, but FUE is becoming more popular because it causes less scarring.

Surgeon uses one of the methods of **follicular unit transplantation (FUT)** and **follicular unit extraction (FUE)** to obtain follicles.

##### **In follicular unit transplantation (FUT):**

A strip of skin containing many hair follicles is removed from the back of the head and then divided into small units called grafts. These grafts are transplanted to bald or thinning areas on top of the head.

##### **In follicular unit extraction (FUE);**

Individual hairs are removed one at a time from around the scalp and then transplanted to bald or thinning areas.

A single hair transplant session can take approximately **6-8 hours**. You may need **3-4 sessions** to achieve the desired result. For the healing process, it is necessary to wait a **few months** between sessions.

## **Hair Transplant Recovery**

You may feel some discomfort on the scalp in the days after the surgery. You may need to take pain medication for a few days. Doctor may prescribe an antibiotic or an anti-inflammatory drug.

Most people can **return to work several days** after surgery.

The transplanted hair falls out **2-3 weeks** after the procedure. But within a few months, your new hair should start to grow. It usually takes **8-12 months** for your new hair to start growing.

## **Risks and Complications**

As with any surgery, Hair Transplant also has some risks;

* Folliculitis - inflammation or an infection of the hair follicles
* Bleeding
* Unnatural-looking
* Shock loss - typically temporary loss of the transplanted hair

If you experience any of these problems, contact your doctor.
