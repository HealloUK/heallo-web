description: Facelit surgery is a surgical procedure that improves the
  appearance of the face. It can be used to correct wrinkles, sagging skin, and
  other signs of aging. The surgery is performed by removing excess fat and skin
  from the face and neck, and then tightening the muscles in the area. In this
  article, we will examine the stages of the facelift procedure and the details
  of these stages.

## Anesthesia

Numbing medications or general anesthesia may be used during the procedure. Your doctor decides what kind of anesthesia to use.

## The Incision

The incision for your facelift procedure is made at the hairline, in the hairless area behind your ears. The surgeon will cut through skin and muscle to expose the underlying structures of the face, including bone and fat.

The surgeon then removes excess fat from around the face and neck and repositions remaining fat to give you a more youthful appearance.

In some cases, additional measures may be taken to tighten loose skin or lift sagging tissue around the jowl area (cheeks).

After removing excess fat from around your neck and chin, your surgeon may trim small amounts of tissue from these areas. This reduces jowls and undercuts chin puffiness.

## Closing the Incisions

The incision is then closed with stitches or staples and bandages are applied. The stitches are removed after about 10 days, and you can expect to start seeing results almost immediately. Your new face will be more youthful and beautiful!

## Result

The results of a facelift are not immediately visible because swelling and bruising delay the full effect. During the first week after a facelift, your face may appear swollen and bruised. This normal postoperative reaction will gradually improve over the next three to four weeks. You should be able to return to work within one week following surgery.
